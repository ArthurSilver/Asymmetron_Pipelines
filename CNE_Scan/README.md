## Search_Conserved_Bases.pl
Perl script for scanning the conserved bases in MAF file generated by CACTUS.
Before running the script, we need to use cactus-hal2maf to convert the hal file to maf file, and then divide the maf file to seperate files according to chromosomes. 
### step1 split the maf file
Because the Phylop limit the size of input files, we need to further split the maf files to sperate files  with a sequence length of 1M.
If the reference sequence is aligned to different regions of a species, we will retain only one sequence for each species.
### step2 calculate phylop
Run the Phylop on the seperated maf files.
### step3 count the depth and phylop score of bases
Calculate the phylop score for each base and how many species are aligned to this base in each block.
## Search_CNEs.pl
Perl script for scanning the conserved blocks based on the chainNet file generated by lastZ.
### Record the chromosome length infomation
To convert the coordinates of minus strand, we need to record the chromosome length of each species.
### Extract the block which length >20 and identity>60%, and convert the coordinates of minus strand
Extract the candidate pair alignment (length >20 and identity>60%) and record the coordinates in bed file, noticed that the minus strand need to convert the coordinates.
### Intersect target candidates using bedtools
### Convert Al coordinates to Hs and make pair
### Extract sequence from block pair, align again using muscle and the second screening
### Annotate the block pair and screen the results based on the annotation
